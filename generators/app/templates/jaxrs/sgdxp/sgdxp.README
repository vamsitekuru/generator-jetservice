For runtime use you will need to install the Service Guard module in your local DXP environment.

The JAR file is included in this folder as sgdxp.jar.

The simplest approach for installing the JAR is to copy it into the deploy directory
of your DXP installation.

(If you prefer, Service Guard can also be installed using the DXP gogo shell with the URL
value of http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/xtivia/tools/sgdxp/1.0.0/sgdxp-1.0.0.jar).
