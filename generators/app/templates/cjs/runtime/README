These files constitute the runtime environment for JetService scripted services.

Install these files (by copying into DXP deploy directory) in the order listed below.
Note that these files only need to be installed *once* (i.e. not required on every
service project)

1. org.jetservice.nashorn.extension.jar
2. org.jetservice.runtime.jar
3. org.jetservice.runtime.mysql.jar (only if you intend to use MySql database features)

Then restart DXP.
